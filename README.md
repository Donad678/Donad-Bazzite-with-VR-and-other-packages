# Donad Bazzite VR Image

# Purpose

Modified Bazzite image, added build dependencies for what I use in Envision as well as building and installing envision itself

Also added a some programs, for personal use, might miss dependencies you need in Envision

rebase to it with: 

GNOME: rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/donad678/donad-bazzite-gnome:latest


KDE: rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/donad678/donad-bazzite-kde:latest

or download the ISO from the latest build artifact
